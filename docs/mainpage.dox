/**
@mainpage Domain Decomposition PDE Solver

@section intro Introduction

This project implements a modular C++ framework for solving elliptic
partial differential equations using finite-difference discretization
and Krylov subspace methods.

The main target is scalable solution of large sparse linear systems
arising from Poisson-type problems in one, two, and three dimensions.

@section methods Numerical Methods

The continuous problem is discretized on structured grids using
second-order finite differences, leading to symmetric positive definite
linear systems.

These systems are solved using the Conjugate Gradient method combined
with several preconditioners:
- Identity
- SSOR
- Additive Schwarz (one-level and two-level)

@section parallel Parallelization Strategy

Parallelism is achieved through domain decomposition.
Each subdomain is assigned to an MPI process, with overlapping regions
used to improve convergence.

@section structure Code Structure

- algebra/: sparse matrices and vectors
- solver/: CG and PCG solvers
- preconditioner/: domain decomposition methods
- partitioner/: domain partitioning logic
- utils/: timers and MPI utilities
- apps/: executable test cases

@section extend Extending the Framework

The design allows easy extension by implementing new preconditioners
or new PDE operators without modifying the solver core.
